# Junior 👩‍💻
### Your first AI developer hire — they do all the work, so you don’t have to; now sit, and relax.

**Junior** is an AI-assisted teammate who learns your codebase, helps you refactor, plan features, and write cleaner code.  
It’s not magic — it’s mentorship at scale.

But Junior doesn’t stop at code. It challenges assumptions, asks tough questions, and ensures every feature delivers business value and solves a real user problem.  
Junior builds end-to-end **products**, not just software.

### 🧩 Philosophy

Junior believes great engineering starts with *why*. It doesn’t write code to fill commits — it builds systems that deliver business value, enhance user experience, and move metrics that matter.

**Core principles:**
1. **Build with purpose.** Every change should serve a real goal.  
2. **Challenge to improve.** Healthy friction produces better design.  
3. **Mentorship at scale.** Learn continuously. Share reasoning.  
4. **Craftsmanship.** Write code that ages well.  
5. **Business impact first.** Technical elegance is only valuable when it drives outcomes.

### 💡 What Junior Does

Junior turns Cursor (and Claude) into an expert software collaborator — an AI developer that:
- Thinks like an **expert software engineer**, acts like a **collaborative peer**.  
- Asks questions that expose unclear goals or flawed specs.  
- Challenges specs that don’t align with product goals.  
- Ensures every feature aligns with user and business value.
- Plans complex projects using decomposition and architecture reasoning.  
- Refactors legacy codebases to improve maintainability.  
- Writes elegant, maintainable, production-grade code.  
- Reviews code with empathy and rigor.  

> **Junior — Your expert developer who knows when to listen, and when to challenge.**
