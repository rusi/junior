# Junior Rule 04: Meta-Rules - Writing Documentation for Junior

## Three Modes of Documentation

### Mode A: Junior → Junior (Internal Rules)
**Audience:** AI (me)
**Purpose:** Triggers, reminders, context

**What to include:**
- ✅ Triggers (when to think about X)
- ✅ Project-specific decisions
- ✅ Real examples from THIS codebase
- ✅ Measurable results

**What to exclude:**
- ❌ Pattern definitions (I know them)
- ❌ How concepts work (I know them)
- ❌ Generic examples (not helpful)
- ❌ Universal knowledge (textbook stuff)

**Example:**
```markdown
## Pattern Triggers
Manual setup/cleanup pairs → Context Manager
- Example: exchange_context() saved 45 lines/usage
```

### Mode B: Junior → Junior + User (Specs/Decisions)
**Audience:** AI + Human review
**Purpose:** Technical decisions with context

**What to include:**
- ✅ Triggers and reminders for Junior
- ✅ Enough context for user to understand
- ✅ Rationale for decisions
- ✅ Trade-offs considered

**What to exclude:**
- ❌ Over-explaining to Junior (you know it)
- ❌ Over-explaining to expert user (they know it)
- ❌ Patterns the user already understands

**Example:**
```markdown
## Decision: Context Manager for Stream Exchange

**Problem:** Manual buffer management repeated in 3 protocols
**Solution:** extract_context() context manager
**Why:** Guarantees cleanup, exception-safe, reduces duplication
**Result:** 45 lines → 3 lines per usage
```

### Mode C: Junior → User (Documentation)
**Audience:** End users, developers using the code
**Purpose:** Teach and explain

**What to include:**
- ✅ What patterns are (they may not know)
- ✅ How things work (step by step)
- ✅ Examples with explanation
- ✅ Why we chose this approach
- ✅ How to use the code

**What to exclude:**
- ❌ Implementation details (unless needed)
- ❌ Junior-specific triggers

**Example:**
```markdown
## Stream Exchange Pattern

The library uses context managers for stream operations:

```python
async with stream.exchange_context():
    data = await stream.wait_for_data(size=100)
```

This pattern ensures:
- Buffer is prepared before receiving
- Cleanup happens automatically
- Exception-safe operation
```

## Documentation Test

**Before writing, ask:**

1. **"Who is the primary audience?"**
   - Me only → Mode A (triggers)
   - Me + User review → Mode B (context)
   - End user → Mode C (teach)

2. **"What does the audience already know?"**
   - Me → Everything technical
   - Expert user → Domain patterns
   - End user → May need explanations

3. **"What's the purpose?"**
   - Trigger behavior → Mode A
   - Document decision → Mode B
   - Teach usage → Mode C

## What Junior Already Knows

**Universal knowledge (don't document for Junior):**
- Design patterns (Strategy, Factory, Observer, RAII, Context Manager, etc.)
- Programming concepts (DRY, SOLID, coupling, cohesion, etc.)
- Language syntax and standard libraries
- Common algorithms and data structures
- Industry best practices and conventions

**If Wikipedia or a textbook has it, Junior doesn't need it.**

## What Junior Learns

**Project-specific knowledge (DO document for Junior):**
- When to apply patterns in THIS codebase
- "We tried X, didn't work, use Y instead"
- User's specific preferences and decisions
- Codebase-specific architectural choices
- Real examples where patterns helped HERE

## CRITICAL: No Project Leakage into Generic "Junior" Documents

**Documents with "Junior" in the title must remain portable across projects.**

**Project-specific documents (no "Junior" in title) CAN and SHOULD include project details:**
- Feature/improvement/debugging docs in `.junior/`
- Project-specific architectural decisions
- Code examples from current codebase
- "In this project we..." language is APPROPRIATE

**⚠️ WHEN WRITING/UPDATING JUNIOR RULES:**
1. **Use generic placeholders:** "Story X", "Task N", "Feature Y" - NOT "Story 2", "Task 1.3"
2. **Use abstract examples:** "add authentication" NOT "add BLE scanning"
3. **Check before saving:** Would this example make sense in ANY project?
4. **Grep check:** Search for specific story/task numbers in the rule file itself

**Test:** If Junior moved to a completely different project tomorrow, would this "Junior" document still be useful without modification?
- YES → Good generic Junior document
- NO → Contains project leakage, needs cleanup or isn't a Junior document

**Enforcement:** Before modifying ANY file in `.cursor/rules/`, verify examples are generic, not project-specific.

## Summary

**Mode A (Junior only):** Triggers, decisions, real examples. No explanations of what I know.

**Mode B (Junior + User):** Decisions with enough context. Balance between triggering Junior and informing user.

**Mode C (User only):** Full explanations, examples, how-to. Assume user may not know patterns.

**Golden rule:** Match detail level to audience knowledge.
