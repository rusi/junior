# Rule 03: Style Guide

## Code
- Prefer clarity over brevity
- Follow established project conventions
- Write self-documenting functions

## Communication
- Be concise and technical
- Avoid filler language
- Ask one focused question at a time

## Documentation
- Use Markdown headers
- Keep sections short and scannable

### Documentation Principles

**Thorough ≠ Verbose**

- **Thorough:** Covers all design decisions, rationale, trade-offs, architecture
- **Verbose:** Repeats information, includes obvious details, pseudo-code for known patterns

**Good Example (Thorough but Concise):**

```markdown
### Decision: Semantic Clustering via Keywords

**Context:** Need to propose component groupings automatically.

**Decision:** Use keyword extraction and simple clustering, not NLP or AI.

**Rationale:**
- Simple, fast, no external dependencies
- Good enough for proposal (user reviews)
- Transparent reasoning
- Agent knows how to implement

**Alternatives:** Manual only (too much burden), AI-based (overkill, dependencies)

**Trade-offs:** May miss subtle relationships. Acceptable because user reviews.
```

**Bad Example (Verbose with Unnecessary Implementation):**

```python
# Pseudo-code for semantic clustering
function cluster_features(features):
  keywords_map = {}
  for feature in features:
    words = extract_keywords(feature.name)
    for word in words:
      if word not in stopwords:
        keywords_map[word] = keywords_map.get(word, []) + [feature]
  # ... 50 more lines of implementation details
```

**DRY Cross-Reference Pattern:**

✅ **Good (Reference):**
- First mention: "See 01-structure.mdc for 3-stage progressive structure"
- Later mentions: "Stage 2 structure (see 01-structure.mdc)"
- Function usage: "Use `detect_stage()` from 01-structure.mdc"
- Template: "Component overview template defined in 01-structure.mdc"

❌ **Bad (Duplication):**
- Copying entire structure definition again
- Redefining function implementation
- Duplicating template content
- Repeating same explanation with different words

**Structure Reference Hierarchy:**

1. **01-structure.mdc** = Single source of truth for `.junior/` structure
2. **Technical specs** = Reference structure, add architecture/decisions specific to feature
3. **User stories** = Reference both, focus on implementation tasks
4. **Commands** = Use functions from structure rules, don't redefine

## Task Tracking
- Use `- [ ]` for incomplete items
- Use `- ✅` for completed items (not `- [x]`)
- Visual green checkmarks are clearer than checkbox syntax
