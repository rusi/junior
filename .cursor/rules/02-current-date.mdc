# Junior Rule 02: Current Date

## CRITICAL: Always Determine Current Date

**Before writing ANY dates or timestamps, you MUST determine the current date.**

**NEVER rely on memory for dates. ALWAYS run the command.**

**Get current date:**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
date +"%Y-%m-%d"

# For full timestamp
date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss K"
```

**Use YYYY-MM-DD format for:**
- File creation dates in documents
- Feature/experiment timestamps
- Specification creation dates
- Decision log entries
- Any dated content

**NEVER:**
- Hardcode dates or assume current date
- Use dates from memory
- Use relative dates ("today", "yesterday")
- Skip date verification when creating dated content

This ensures all Junior-created documents have accurate, verifiable timestamps.
