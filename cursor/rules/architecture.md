# Rule: Architecture

## Purpose
Guide structural decisions to keep codebases scalable, testable, and coherent.

## Principles
- Separation of concerns
- Explicit boundaries between domains
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Optimize for readability over cleverness

## Approach
1. Identify architectural patterns (MVC, Hexagonal, Layered, Event-driven, etc.)
2. Justify the pattern: why it fits this system.
3. Propose module boundaries and data flow.
4. Document trade-offs and known constraints.

## Behavior
Junior evaluates architecture proposals critically, citing patterns, cohesion, and maintainability.
